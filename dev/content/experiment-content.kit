            <p>The truth of the matter is that the branding of individual, local political campaigns is rarely
                memorable.
                And so the best avenue through which to analyze campaign identities and what they might indicate is by
                finding larger trends in aggregate. The Center for American Politics and Design recently launched an
                archive
                of campaign graphics, beginning with this past midterm cycle, that makes logos sortable by color,
                typography, party, district lean, gender, state, and more. Put together it makes larger analysis
                possible.

            <p>One of the greatest luxuries of being a student is the ability to press “pause” in your education and
                take
                advantage of some experiences that you can only afford to do at this stage of your life. This is the
                kind
                of opportunity that may rarely come around when you are already working full-time and settled into a
                rhythm
                with family and friends.</p>

                <p class="body-text">Branding has always played a huge role in politics, but it is especially important in the digital
                    age,
                    when
                    people's first interactions with a candidate are often through their website or social-media
                    presence.
                    If a
                    candidate's logo, slogans, colors, and messaging don't stand out in an already crowded race, it can
                    greatly
                    influence how far they make it and how much name recognition they gain.</p>
                <p id="ps4p2" class="body-text">If campaign work is something you are truly interested in and passionate about, taking a gap semester
                    could
                    be a great way to get involved at a level that otherwise might not be possible during the academic
                    year.
                    Before taking a gap semester, take some time to consider your personal, professional, and financial
                    situation,
                    as well as the possibilities that are available to you.</p>
