                             Whether it’s the Superbowl, World Cup or World Series, sports fans never have to wonder who’s who on the
                             field. Not with their team’s colors and carefully crafted logo plastered all over the stadium. But the big
                             game isn’t the only place where logos are visually dominant. In politics, campaign logos are one of the most
                             recognizable visuals of an election bid, second only to photographs of the candidate. “Ultimately, a logo’s
                             job is to build remembrance,” designer Sky Hartman told CNN in 2015. “If you can design a concept that
                             sticks in people’s minds, you’ve been successful.” Political logos, though, have only really emerged as
                             major visual campaign tools in recent decades. Sponsored Most candidates nowadays typically tap the skills
                             of high-end design firms, hoping the branding magic that have helped make MasterCard and McDonald’s
                             instantly recognizable will rub off on them as well. The result is usually a red-white-and-blue version of a
                             candidate's name -- or more likely one of their initials -- that tries to establish a recognizable brand by
                             packing the essence of their candidacy in a succinct visual statement.

                                 Because a logo is a single image with just a few design elements, every artistic choice counts. Mark
                                 Winn, a Bay Area painter and designer, starts his logo design process with a written list of
                                 characteristics that he’s trying to capture. He then begins experimenting with multiple versions of a
                                 single image. Like Winn’s personal logos, most political logos draw from a menu of colors, typefaces and
                                 graphic flourishes to convey something distinctive about a candidate or campaign message. With such a
                                 small canvas to work with, the slightest adjustment can pack a visual punch or even define the
                                 conversation.

                                 Given the amount of thought that goes into modern political logos, it’s no surprise that they are often
                                 critiqued like artistic masterpieces, with observers weighing in on every last curve of a letter or use
                                 of punctuation. During the 2016 primary season, major news outlets, including The Washington Post,
                                 Bloomberg and CNN, featured design experts who painstakingly analyzed each candidate’s logo. Even
                                 late-night TV hosts Jimmy Fallon and Stephen Colbert joined in, poking fun at the exclamation point at
                                 the end of Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush’s logo. (Eventually, even Bush himself cracked
                                 jokes at his logo’s expense). The original Students for Trump logo. The original Students for Trump
                                 logo. (Wikipedia)

                                 But jibes about punctuation are mild compared to the reaction to the first iteration of the Trump-Pence
                                 campaign logo unveiled in August 2016. The interlocking of the T in Trump and P in Pence caused a flurry
                                 of commentary, off-color jokes and artistic scorn. The flap blew over only when a second, very different
                                 image replaced the first, a notable switch given how rarely campaigns switch logos once they've gone
                                 they’ve gone public. The final logo. The second draft. (Wikipedia) Hillary Clinton’s 2016 logo was also
                                 widely panned for its right-pointing arrow and “FedEx feel." Despite the criticisms, though, the logo
                                 endured. “(A logo) is only one tool and it’s not more than a means to an end,” Michael Bierut, who
                                 designed Hillary Clinton’s 2016 logo told Wired magazine in 2016. “People don’t vote for logos. They
                                 vote for candidates.”
